the mor programming language

== syntax

[source, mor]
----
// TODO: currently working on functions so they 
// do not work right now but should very soon
fib :: (n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return 1
    }

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}

// NOTE: semicolons are currently not used
// but should be in the future
main :: () {
    amount := 20

    result := fib(amount)
}
----

== features

Should be reasonable fast and low level to properly interact with the operating system. 
This is currently achieved by the $asm() compiler-macro which can be used to make syscalls
and store the values of the registers into variables.
It should also provide some zero cost abstractions to make things simpler and not slower as well as
some reasonable syntax sugar for certain cases (e.g. indexing from the back of an array or container)
